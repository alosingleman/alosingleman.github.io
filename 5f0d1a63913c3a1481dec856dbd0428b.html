					 <strong>French bench press: the most effective exercise? How can I save my elbows from injury?</strong><p><span>Is it true that the French bench press is most effective for training the triceps? Or is it still better to focus on more basic, multi-joint exercises such as the bench press with a narrow grip or the bars? Today I will answer these questions, we will talk about how to avoid injuries that are fraught with French, and we will also reveal some secrets of the French bench press, which no one else will tell you about.</span></p><p><span>The problem with the triceps is that more than 50% of people who train, the load when performing basic exercises is eaten up by non-target muscles. </span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div></div></div><p><span>In the press with a narrow grip, athletes often complain that the load has gone to the front deltas, chest muscles, anywhere but the triceps. Also on the uneven bars, no matter how you perform this movement, and the chest and shoulders devour almost all the load and muscles does not receive much-needed mechanical stress.</span></p><p><span>I remind You that according to a study by American scientist Chris Beardsley, it is mechanical stress that is the main factor in muscle growth. Therefore, if the target muscle does not receive a strictly defined mechanical impulse, about strong and developed we can't even dream of triceps.</span></p><p><span>At the beginning of my training path, I read in the literature that the triceps is well loaded in all basic exercises, including the bench press. Therefore, I did not worry about my triceps, focusing on the bench press and balks.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>What was my disappointment when I realized that my hands were not growing from an indirect load! From pull-UPS I grew only my back, and from the bench press only my chest! My biceps and triceps didn't grow a millimeter, but my arms were still in their early 30s inches, and still remained. Then I "slapped" two of the most effective exercises for the hands: this is the bending of the arms standing with a straight bar and the French bench press. </span></p><p><span>My biceps and triceps started to grow, and I was able to increase my arms by 12 cm in circumference in just one year! Of course, we are talking about natural bodybuilding, but professionally, I started much later.</span></p><p><span>A few years later, I reached 70 kilograms in the French bench press, and both my elbows began to hurt terribly! The pain was such that I could no longer perform French at all, even with a 20 kg barbell! The recovery took almost a year, and during that time I was only able to train my triceps basic exercise. As a result, there was a slight "pullback" in the development of this muscle.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>This does not mean that the weight of 70 kg is dangerous For someone it will be 50 or 80 kg, you need to use the principle of individual approach. However, these problems can not be solved at all avoid it by reviewing your attitude to the exercise and using the tips below.</span></p><p><span><b>Useful tips for performing the French bench press</b></span></p><ul><li><span>By performing this exercise while lying on the floor, you will be able to lift the bar yourself and you will not need the help of a partner.</span></li><li><span>French bench press with dumbbells can it may seem like a more comfortable movement for your elbows, but in my opinion it is a less powerful and more dangerous exercise (you need perfect control).</span></li><li><span>Do French lying on a flat platform, then the barbell will not touch the floor with the pancakes, but you will be as comfortable as possible to perform the exercise.</span></li><li><span>Lower the bar not to to the forehead, and to the top of the head.</span></li><li><span>Pull your arms back before starting the exercise, and keep them drawn back constantly, so that your triceps will not lose weight when the barbell is at the top of the movement</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><span>Make 3 working sets in extension of the arms on the upper block for 8-10 repetitions "until failure". Then (with the second exercise), start doing the French press.</span></li><li><span>Unlike other strength exercises, where progress is maximized at 6-8 reps, you should perform about 10-12 reps in the bench press, thereby lowering the weight and reducing the risk of injury. traumatism.</span></li><li><span>The most effective French bench press, when working with a curved barbell with a narrow grip.</span></li><li><span>The most traumatic style of French bench press is in the standing or sitting position. Less dangerous is French on an inclined bench. The most gentle versions of the French bench press, head down on the back-sloping bench, or on the a horizontal bench.</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>French bench press with 1 or 2 dumbbells sitting, another good version of the French bench press, you can use it for a change.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>The equipment of the French press</b></span></p><ol><li><span>Lie down on a horizontal bench for the French press or on an ordinary bench.</span></li><li><span>Remove the bar from the racks or take it from your partner's hands</span></li><li><span>Bend your arms bringing the bar to your forehead or to the top of your head (depending on the style of execution)</span></li><li><span>Straighten your arms completely. In the classic version, the neck stops above the forehead, in the improved version, the hands are drawn back, the neck is located slightly behind your forehead.</span></li><li><span>Bend your arms slowly and inhale, then straighten them with a powerful movement as you exhale.</span></li></ol><p><span><b>Watch a video showing all the nuances of the French bench press technique in the prone, sitting and standing positions.
