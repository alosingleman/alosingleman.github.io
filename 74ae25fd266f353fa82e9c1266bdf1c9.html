					 <strong>Katya managed to look fat at 65 kg: how she lost weight in 45 years</strong><p><span>Since childhood, Catherine had a completely normal weight, for example, she graduated from school with a weight of 50 kg. She was never overweight or thin, always 50-52, of normal build, and "nothing foreshadowed trouble."</span></p><p><span>Years passed, Katya got married, gave birth to her first child, then a second, and somehow imperceptibly by the age of 35, she felt like a fat aunt. Her body weight on the scales reached the mark of 65 kg. </span></p><p><span>With a height of at least 170 cm, this would be quite normal, but at 158 cm of our heroine, these 15 extra pounds looked much worse than you can imagine imagine that!</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Photo at a young age, in school and as a student, with a body weight of about 50 kg</span></figcaption></figure><div><div></div></div><p><span>Ekaterina of course began to try different diets from magazines, fasting, various exercises… It wasn't that simple! She was barely losing weight, but the result was not able to hold, after losing weight, the bent kilograms were returned back. </span></p><p><span>If you have also experienced a similar "reverse spring" effect in weight loss and know how difficult it is to keep your shape, write about it in the comment section at the bottom of the article, and we will return to the continuation of the story.</span></p><p><span>So in fruitless attempts to lose weight lasted almost 10 years, from about 35 to 44 years old. Katya got tired of this swing, she realized: "the years go by, and I want to be beautiful today and constantly, and not in the future»</span></p><p><span>At some fateful moment, she somehow became particularly attuned, became motivated, and decided that she would constantly maintain excellent communication skills the form!</span></p><p><span>Catherine was helped to get into shape by intensive training and a very strict diet! She trained three times a week in the gym, ran 5-6 times a week for an hour at the stadium and at the same time ate very small portions, mainly natural protein products.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>This is how Ekaterina looked after 35-37 years, when she began to worry about the problem of a " large aunt"</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>With the help of such a Spartan regime, she managed to achieve a result in 6 months that she never had. She has lost a lot of weight, even up to 47 kg! Such she wasn't even skinny at school.</span></p><p><span>At the end of her weight loss, Katya consumed up to 500 calories a day, and sometimes less than 400 or even 300 calories! It is believed that such hunger strikes and such a low percentage of subcutaneous fat lead a girl to amenorrhea, but in the case of Katya just such a problem did not arise. </span></p><p><span>She felt it there were no signs of any physiological or psychological disorders such as menstrual irregularities or eating disorders.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes she came to the village to visit her relatives where a feast was waiting for her. But even then she found a way out so as not to gain extra weight! To their feasts Katya prepared diet poultry, vegetable salads in advance, and when everyone began to eat, she not only did not break down on harmful food, but also persuaded everyone at the table to try how delicious and useful healthy food "for weight loss"can be.</span></p><p><span>As a result, the problem did not come in the form of any health problems or psychics that promise in such cases traditionally appear out of nowhere persons known as "envious of successful people".</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Two extremes: a photo at 44 years old with excess weight, and over-dried photos six months later. </span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Having lost too much weight Katya understood:</span></h2><ul><li><span>Clearly there is not enough muscle mass, the body is not muscular enough to possess the correct and beautiful proportions.</span></li><li><span>After losing the last few pounds, Katya's face became haggard and wrinkled, and she began to look older than her years. An increase in the age of 10-15 years was felt purely visually.</span></li></ul><p><span>But, not Katina haters had time to exclaim with joy, as she turned ugly, the girl adjusted her diet a little, added a couple of kilograms of weight and immediately began to look much better and younger! At the same time, her former plump form did not return, so the victory seemed to be observed "on all fronts"!</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, she was aware that if you relax, everything can get worse again and I decided to find a mentor who will help you review the program, lose weight without wasting and such an ugly lack of muscle mass. So lucky that this mentor was me. </span></p><p><span>I was very interested in analyzing Katya's sporting past and I want to add to that in this story, we have a couple of tips on what you could do to make the result even better!</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>This is how Ekaterina looks today, with no excess fat, no excessive thinness or aging wrinkles from exhaustion, but she is striving for more!</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>When losing weight, it was at least three errors were made:</b></span></p><ol><li><span>Insufficient use of fat in the diet of a girl. If Katya consumed at least 40 grams of fat per day, then perhaps the skin around her body would retain a more beautiful appearance.</span></li><li><span>I didn't gain enough muscle mass before losing weight. If you don't do squats, do the bench press legs and other exercises with decent weights, you have nothing to dry!</span></li><li><span>When losing weight, quite intense cardio was used, this helps you lose weight, but unfortunately not at the expense of fat. The body becomes more lean and wrinkled than athletic and beautiful.</span></li></ol><p><span>I suggested that Katya go through the drying process again, but having already adjusted her own actions with me. But, here there was a problem of self-isolation: my new student did not have a barbell for 90 kg at home, namely with this weight (as it turned out) she is able to perform the "glute bridge" exercise.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>This is what Katya looks like with the clothes she has been wearing for 6 months back.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Nevertheless, we decided to start training on Skype and choose powerful exercises at home that can replace the basic exercises in the gym. Take the same Bulgarian squats with dumbbells!</span></p><p><span> You can squat on one leg putting the other toe on the sofa and the load on the glute she will become very worthy. This will allow you to recruit most of the muscle fibers of the buttock muscle, and not lose your feminine beauty and your "nuts" in the process of losing weight.</span></p><p><span>These are our plans and this is the real story of Katya today. It's all written down from the girl's words and I hope I haven't allowed myself any trouble anywhere conjectures'. I hope we will come back with a continuation of this story, when we get even more impressive results!</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>It seems to me that both options are extreme, but the second option is preferable in terms of health and longevity, so what do you think? It's gold to me the middle is just right!</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>To support me as an author on my channel, and also read my </span><span></span><a>article</a><span> how a girl from Latvia named Leva dramatically changed herself at the age of 34!</span></p><p><span> My personal </span><span></span><a><i><b>online training</b></i></a><span> sessions and </span><span></span><a><i><b>fitness marathon</b></i></a><span> </span><span><i><b>"Zhirotopka"</b></i></span><span> </span><span><i>My:</i></span><span> </span><span></span><a><b></b></a><span><b>,</b></span><span> </span><span></span><a><b></b></a><span></span><span><b>fitness channel,</b></span><span> </span><span></span><a><b>Instagram</b></a><span><b>,</b></span><span></span><a><b>,</b></a><span></span><a><b>Telegram</b></a><span> On the channel </span><span></span><a>psychology of Yuri Spasokukotsky</a><span> I share my secrets of happiness in my personal life. </span></p><div></div>
