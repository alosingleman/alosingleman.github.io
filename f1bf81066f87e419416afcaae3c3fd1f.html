					 <strong>How to perform the exercise approaches: to failure or not to failure?</strong><p><span>When performing any exercise, even with a small weight, you can achieve a state of muscle "failure", when you will no longer be able to "squeeze" at least one more repetition (to contract the muscle). An eccentric failure can also be achieved, by performing negative repetitions (so that you can no longer even lower the weight, and not just lift it). </span></p><p><span>Too much exercise causes excessive muscle damage and we will need too much time to recover – up to a month (which is why I don't practice negatives). </span></p><p><span>On today, many scientists are inclined to the theory that it is most effective to perform the exercise until the muscles fail, although training practice shows that muscle hypertrophy and strength indicators are possible even without achieving failure.</span></p><div><div></div></div><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>To failure or not to failure? How do the exercises?</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>American scientist Chris Beardsley in his articles on mechanical stress (the main factor of muscle growth) publishes the results of a number of studies on this subject. </span></p><p><span>They lead us to the conclusion that when working with a large weight (80% of the one-time maximum or more) performing a failure set is no longer mandatory, because each repetition already stimulates the growth of high-threshold muscle fibers, which have the greatest potential for hypertrophy.</span></p><p><span>When working with average working weights (60-70%), you need to work until failure or almost failure, otherwise hypertrophy may not occur at all happen. </span></p><p><span><b>Failure forces can be at the level of the Central nervous system, or at the level of the peripheral nervous system: </b></span></p><p><span>Failure at the level of the CNS occurs if the input of an impulse at the "brain-muscle" level decreases. Excitability of motor neurons decreases in this case. </span></p><p><span>"The Central failure» it occurs for a long time under load, when performing a large number of repetitions, when the weight is small and you feel more unable to tolerate these painful sensations (burning, fatigue) than the weight itself. Roughly speaking, your brain is no longer able to generate an impulse to make your muscles work decrease.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>How best to perform approaches to failure or not to failure</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Peripheral failure is fatigue that is caused by processes that occur in the working muscle itself. The muscle receives a powerful order from the brain – but it is no longer able to execute it team. If you try 10 times to lift a weight that you can only manage in nine repetitions, then on the 10th repetition you will face such a failure.</span></p><p><span>From a scientific point of view, it is the peripheral failure that best contributes to muscle hypertrophy, so in power sports, it is recommended to perform more low number of repetitions - less than 15 and even 5-10 (Chris Beardsley).</span></p><p><span><b>Advantages of training to failure</b></span></p><ul><li><span>It is much easier to pick up working weights when working in a restaurant. Just set the weight with which you can do the specified number of repetitions and no more. Therefore, complex calculations and calculations are not required. great methodological knowledge.</span></li><li><span>As a rule, athletes with an experience of from one to two months to two to three years (beginners should not work in groups, during the first 10-20 training sessions) perfectly progress by performing a small number of approaches to failure: 5-8 approaches for each muscle group per training session. </span></li><li><span>Intensive, failed workouts can be shorter, which reduces the time spent in the gym. You can effectively train for 30-90 minutes.</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>How to perform approaches correctly, what weight to use</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Minuses rejection</b></span></p><ul><li><span>Working to complete exhaustion damages the muscles more, and between heavy workouts you have to give a long pause: 7-14 days, and sometimes 3-4 weeks!</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Such work puts more stress on all systems of the body. The immune system, endocrine and nervous systems gradually become depleted. as a result, sooner or later there is a "plateau" or "stagnation" in the training process: working weights and muscles no longer grow, there may be "stomping on the spot" or even regression.</span></li><li><span>Injuries when working with maximum loads are also high. There are both cumulative and acute injuries and microtrauma, which they are thrown back in progress for months, and sometimes for many years.</span></li></ul><p><span><b>The advantages of the workout without failure</b></span></p><ul><li><span>Such trainings contribute to the restoration of all systems of the body, improve well-being and health, restore and increase the energy of our body.</span></li><li><span> "Half-strength" training is low injuries and good rehabilitation of injuries (in fact, this is physical therapy). </span></li><li><span>Train as often as possible, up to daily workouts without the need for recovery and complete rest. The recovery time between workouts depends on the dosage loads'.</span></li></ul><p><span><b>Minuses</b></span></p><ul><li><span>Trying to progress "fail-safe" athletes have to calculate working weights as a percentage of the one-time maximum, the so-called "percentages", which is quite a difficult process.</span></li><li><span>In order to increase the working weight or to induce hypertrophy for to achieve progress with lower weights, you need to increase the number of sets – increase the volume of loads. Sometimes athletes perform too much and this also leads to exhaustion and increased injuries, as well as failure training.</span></li><li><span>Training can take a very long time. Sometimes up to 3-4 hours. </span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Is it useful to train in the future?</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>What should I choose for the best training progress?</b></span></p><p><span>Beginners with training experience of up to 1-2 months should concentrate on technique and work with light and medium working weights. Approaches it is undesirable to perform to the point of failure, since the body does not yet have proper training.</span></p><p><span>Advanced ones who have training experience of 2-3 months to 2-3 years can successfully progress by constantly training in the future. Working weights are still moderate, the body has enough strength to recover and grow. Injuries are also minor, provided that you thoroughly warm up before the approaches.</span></p><p><span>Experienced athletes are faced with the problem of over-training and injury. Strength indicators after 2-3 years of failure training begin to grow slowly, as well as pain in the joints and ligaments of the muscles. If you get into a state of "stagnation" or start to " feel knees" (elbows, shoulders), it is time to reduce the weight and work without failure. </span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, even Champions who claim to constantly train without failure, in practice still periodically use a very heavy weight, even if not every week. This is what triggers the growth process, not working on training with your lungs and heart. average weights.</span></p><p><span>I have also noticed that some athletes who are formally training in the United States, dilute their training with light non-refusal workouts. This clearly shows that both types of training should be used to achieve the best results. </span></p><p><span>Based on these considerations I I developed a program called Jason "Nano", for experienced users, which is available for free. The program includes both heavy and light workouts and allows you to achieve muscle growth without overloading the joints, get out of the training plateau and quickly progress.</span></p><p><span>For greater clarity I have added a video clip to this article (below):</span></p><div><div><div></div></div></div><p><span>Remember that the highest reward for me is your good results, try hard!
